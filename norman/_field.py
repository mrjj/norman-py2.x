    """ A `Field` is used in tables to define attributes of data.
    
    When a table is created, fields can be identified by using a `Field` 
    object:
    
    >>> class Table:
    ...     name = Field()
    
    `Field` objects support *get* and *set* operations, similar to 
    *properties*, but also provide additional options.  They are intended
    for use with `Table` subclasses.
    
    Field options are set as keyword arguments when it is initialised

    Keyword    Default      Description
    ========== ============ ===================================================
    unique     False        True if records should be unique on this field.
                            In database terms, this is the same as setting
                            a primary key.  If more than one field have this 
                            set then records are expected to be unique on all
                            of them.  Unique fields are always indexed.
    index      False        True if the field should be indexed.  Indexed 
                            fields are much faster to look up.  Setting
                            ``unique = True`` implies ``index = True``
    default    None         If missing, `NotSet` is used.
    readonly   False        Prohibits setting the variable, unless its value
                            is `NotSet`.  This can be used with *default*
                            to simulate a constant.
    ========== ============ ===================================================
    
    Note that *unique* and *index* are table-level controls, and are not used
    by `Field` directly.  It is the responsibility of the table to
    implement the necessary constraints and indexes.
