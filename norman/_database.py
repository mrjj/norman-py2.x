class Database(object):
    """ The main database class containing a list of tables.
    
    Tables are added to the database when they are created by giving
    the class a *database* keyword argument.  For example
    
    >>> db = Database()
    >>> class MyTable(Table, database=db):
    ...     name = Field()
    >>> MyTable in db
    True
    
    The database can be written to a sqlite database as file storage.  So
    if a `Database` instance represents a document state, it can be saved
    using the following code:
    
    >>> db.tosqlite('file.sqlite')
    
    And reloaded thus:
    
    >>> db.fromsqlite('file.sqlite')
    
    :note:
        The sqlite database created does not contain any constraints
        at all (not even type constraints).  This is because the sqlite 
        database is meant to be used purely for file storage.
        
    In the sqlite database, all values are saved as strings (determined
    from ``str(value)``.  Keys (foreign and primary) are globally unique
    integers > 0.  *None* is stored as *NULL*, and *NotSet* as 0.
